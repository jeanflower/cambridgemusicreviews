The site index for the review site is managed using a Wordpress widget which contains html.
The index has a link for each article in the site, and the articles are categorised as "Album Reviews", "Live Reviews", etc.

One purpose of this repo is to host scripts which can be used to convert the text of the main Wordpress site into appropriate html text to use for the index panel.

Here's an sample of the HTML in the index widget:
